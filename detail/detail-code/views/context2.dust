{#data}
  Current context: {.}{~n}
  <hr/>
  Dust can search upwards: {foo}{~n}
  <hr/>
  But, it can't search up and then down: {two}{~n}
  <hr/>
  So you need to search up, and then start a new search: {#one}{two}{/one}{~n}
  <hr/>
  Or, you can search up, and then do a dotted lookup: {one.two}
{/data}
